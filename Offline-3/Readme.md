# Geometric shapes with Ray Tracing with appropriate Illumination
 
In this assignment, I have developed a 3D-space containing multiple geometric objects with a fully controllable camera. I used Phong Lighting Model and Ray Tracing with Recursive Reflection method for proper lighting and reflection.

The sample images can be found in the `Outputs` folder.
